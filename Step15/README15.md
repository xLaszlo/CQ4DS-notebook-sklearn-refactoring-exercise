### Step 15: Create `TitanicModel` class

- Create a class that has all the `sklearn` components as member variables
- Instantiate these before the "Training" block
- Use these instead of the local ones

The goal of the whole program is to create a model, despite this until now there was no single object describing this model. The next steps is to establish the concept of this model and what kind of services it is providing for `TitanicModelCreator`.
